COP 3404: Intro to System Software Project 2

Purpose: Create a SIC or SIC/XE program that will have 10 Integers initialized memory in some order. Then reverse the order of the Integers in memory.

Required:
SIC Program assembler
SIC Simulator
Source Code (sicpgm)

To Execute:
Assemble the source code using SIC Assembler. This will generate two files a .obj file and a .lst file.
$ sicasm sicpgm

Start the SIC simulator with the .obj file you generated.
$ sicsim sicpgm.obj

In the Simulator, You will need to rename the first file after 'loader'. At the prompt, enter R to Rename files then press the Enter until the 'loader' appears then hit enter one more time.

Then enter the .obj you used when you started the SIC simulator.

Hit Enter until you get the Accept and Rename prompt again.

Enter A to accept the files.

At the Next Prompt, Start the simulator with the Start (S) command.

Enter the Run (R) command until an error appears say that it attempted to read past a file.

To see the contents in memory of the program, enter the Dump (D) command and the memory address for the program 100-220

Output: sic.log containing all the commands entered and the results of the SIC simulator
